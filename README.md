Welcome to my Personal Portfoli Github Repository. 

![portfolio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36545686/46364414-fa038800-c632-11e8-883d-01712fba4c7a.JPG)

I'd like to reframe from saying to much here, as the portfolio covers most of the good stuff. This portoflio was created using basic HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap as the initial framework for the site's layout. Since this is hosted on Github pages, I was unable to use PHP to handle my form submission, so instead I found a tool called [Simple Form](https://getsimpleform.com/) which handles the form submission through their servers and emails them directly to me.

Feel free to look through the code or visit ther site [here](wradez.github.io).
