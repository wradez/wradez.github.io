Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Github Repository. 

![portfolio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36545686/46364414-fa038800-c632-11e8-883d-01712fba4c7a.JPG)

I'd like to reframe from saying to much here, as the portfolio covers most of the good stuff. This portoflio was created using basic HTML and CSS, with Bootstrap as the initial framework for the site's layout. Since this is hosted on Github pages, I was unable to use PHP or any back-end language/tool to handle my form submission. Instead I found a tool called [Simple Form](https://getsimpleform.com/) which handles the form submission through their servers and emails them to me. If you're here for malicious intent, saved yourself some time. The simpleform link located in the code is for site use only and will not give you access of any kind to view my account. 

Feel free to look through the code or visit the site [here](wradez.github.io). If you'd like to get in touch, send me a connection request on LinkedIn (click the icon at the bottom to link to my LinekdIn page) or send me a message using the contact form.

Thanks for stopping by!
