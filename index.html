                    <p>Hello! I am 25 years old. I love fishing, gaming, and adventures. I have two cats, Grizzly and Nala, but would love to get a dog one day.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy all types of fishing, but recently I have been enjoying fly fishing. I love standing in the middle of a stream/river surrounded by nothing but nature.</p>
                    <p>My prefered gaming platform is PC, but I enjoy a good single player console game from time to time. I have a PS4, XBOX One, Nintendo Switch, and a gaming PC.</p>
                    <p>I know "adventures" is a bit broad, but when I say that I mean this: exploring new locations, new subjects, new ideas, etc. With this definition, an adventrue could be a new game, a new river, a new hike, or a completely different country or city.</p>
